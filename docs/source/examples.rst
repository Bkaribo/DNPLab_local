dnpLab Examples
===============

dnpLab comes with many example scripts to demonstrate how the package can be used to import data from different spectrometer platform, process NMR data and extract enhancement data or hydration information. The example scripts are located in the *examples* folder using sample data located in the *data* folder.

If you installed dnpLab using pip you can download the example scripts and data from the GitHub repository:

Import Data and Process FID (Bruker Format)
===========================================
This example uses the example script: *example_process_1Dbruker.py*. The script demonstrates the following features of dnpLab:

#. Load a single FID (Bruker format)
#. Perform an offset correction
#. Apply apodization to the FID
#. Perform a Fourier transformation
#. Phase correct the resulting spectrum
