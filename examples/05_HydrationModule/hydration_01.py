Analyze ODNP-enhanced NMR and T1 Inversion-Recovery Experiments
===============================================================

This example demonstrates how to perform hydration analysis of Prospa data from ODNP-enhanced NMR and T1 Inversion-Recovery Experiments through a function

To perform the hydration analysis, the following datasets are required:

    1. ODNP_enhanced NMR Experiment (NMR Spectra vs. Microwave Power)
    2. ODNP_enhanced T1 Inversion Recovery Experiment (T1 Inversion Recovery NMR Spectra vs. Microwave Power)
    3. T1 Inversion Recovery Experiment (T1 Inversion Recovery NMR Spectra without radical)
